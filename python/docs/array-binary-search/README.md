# Binary Search of Sorted Array
Setup a Binary search for a sorted array using a key and a preset array. Return -1 if the element isn't in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of finding the middle and finding the middle from that middle if the key wasn't already found. If the element isn't in the list, it would return -1. The Big O should be O(n) for the time as it is linear with the amount of data used is based off how large the array is. The space is consistent, it takes as long as the amount of elements are in the array.
